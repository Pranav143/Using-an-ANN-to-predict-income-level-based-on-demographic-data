# Using an ANN to predict income level based on demographic data
Using PyTorch to implement an Artificial Neural Network to predict a person's salary as below or above $50,000. This is an end to end project that begins with data pre-processing, goes through visualizing each feature, and ends with the learning curve examination of the final model. Note that this project uses PyTorch's dataloader ability to load large amounts of data. Even though the dataset we use isn't very big, it pays to get familiar with this data loading method since in a world of big data and massive datasets, we cannot always just rely on using trivial functions to load data for the training loop.

The main.py file containts the training loop code, as long as the data editing and pre-processing. The code for setting up PyTorch's dataloader features is contained in dataset.py, and model.py contains the class definition of our simple artificial neural network. The file util.py contains some good functions for visualization modules. And finally, the dataset itself is in csv format in the file adult.csv.
